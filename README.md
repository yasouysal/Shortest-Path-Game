# Shortest-Path-Game
This game is an extended version of shortest path algorithms which is transformed into a game with following rules

* Graph is undirected which represents a map of rooms, weights are representing ammo consumption.
* Player starts with some ammo and tries to find the path with least ammo consumption.
* There are 3 special rooms which needs to be visited in order, respectively, to finish the game.
* Some rooms contain ammo.
* Not every room is always open, some of them is locked in odd steps and some of them are locked in even steps.

An exhaustive approach is used to find the best path since improvements to existing shortest path algorithms are not sufficient to solve the problem.
